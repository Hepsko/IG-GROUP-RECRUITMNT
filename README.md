# Envs

Although the project is simple, API keys should not be stored in the repository. Therefore, the project requires the creation of its own file env. local

# Libraries and Technology Stack

**_- NextJS_** - Although the project doesn’t need all the technologies that are included in nextjs, I think it’s a good practice to generate a new project with nextjs, it’s much more scaled than a “create-react-app” It might as well be possible to rebuild the whole project from scratch, but it would be more laborious.

**_- Axios _** - Promised-based HTTP client for JavaScript

**_- React Query _** - data-fetching library for React. Makes it easy to manage application state and helps you avoid boilerplate

**_- Styled components _** - Component styling library

**_- Antd design _** - Package with components, speeds up work when design is not in the first place

**_- Jest _** - Library for testing
